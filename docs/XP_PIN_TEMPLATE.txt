Title: XP: Miner Memory

Content (simple version):
total=1500

Notes:
- Keep the title EXACTLY "XP: Miner Memory" so your backend finds it.
- The parser in your stack will read the first `total=<number>` it sees.
- Pin this message in the progress thread used by your XP backend (your logs show it as the neuro-lite progress thread).
