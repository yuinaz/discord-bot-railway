a99_focus_log_router_final.py â€” SAFE WRAPPER HOTFIX
---------------------------------------------------
Goal: stop infinite routing loops across patched Messageable.send() wrappers
observed as "maximum recursion depth exceeded" and giant call chains through
rate_limit_guard -> public_send_router -> shadow_public_silencer -> dm_muzzle -> a99 -> ...

Strategy: install a *final* lightweight wrapper that:
  - Delegates to the previously installed chain for normal sends
  - Adds a small re-entrancy guard; on re-entry it directly calls the raw
    library send (discord.abc.Messageable.send), which breaks the loop.

This preserves most earlier behaviors (rate limit, muzzle, etc.) for first-hop
sends, but prevents a99 from re-triggering the entire chain when a send is
routed to another destination.
